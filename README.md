# 🏠 House Price Prediction using XGBoost Regression

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting **house prices** based on various socio-economic
and geographical features using a **machine learning regression model**.

The model is trained on the **California Housing Dataset** and uses
**XGBoost Regressor**, a powerful ensemble learning algorithm known for its
high performance on structured data.

The project demonstrates the complete regression workflow including
data loading, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and prediction.
